# About Edis

EDIS is a multi-modular K12 software platform where educators, administrators, and families collaborate and use the power of data to help students succeed.

Here’s how it works.

In its core, EDIS is a powerful Integration System and Data Warehouse that pulls, cleans, and organizes information coming from other systems and files.

Bringing all the clean data into one location allows our Early-Warnings module to constantly monitor key performance indicators and to detect trends in demographics, academics, attendance, behavior, and graduation.

Automatically alerting users of their data changes is a big part of EDIS. 

Our Flipped Data module uses email, text messages, and other innovative channels to tell users of how their data is changing. In EDIS, we understand that keeping track of data is always an exhausting task that steals time away from instruction – which is why we designed it to meet users where they are. Gone are the days of hunting for data, with EDIS, data goes to the user.

Finally, using our secure and easy-to-use web app, our users can build and share reports and beautiful dashboards; create tests and assess students using the latest standards; manage online forms, teacher evaluation data; build interventions, and track student progress all while collaborating with colleagues and parents in any language.

Schools love EDIS because it gives them actionable information and the tools to help students succeed - All in one place.
